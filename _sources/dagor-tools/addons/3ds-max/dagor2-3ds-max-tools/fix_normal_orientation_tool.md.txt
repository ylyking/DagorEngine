## Using the Fix Normal Orientation Tool

The *Fix Normal Orientation Tool* is designed to resolve these issues in most
cases. To correct the normals:

1. In the Viewport, select the objects with incorrect normals.
2. Click the **Fix Normals from Selection** button.

This should correct the normals for the selected objects. In most cases, the
issue is resolved upon re-export. See the screenshot below for an example of the
corrected normals:
