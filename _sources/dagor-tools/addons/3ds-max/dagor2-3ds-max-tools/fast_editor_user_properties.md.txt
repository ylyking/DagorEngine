## Using the Fast Editor User Properties

The panel buttons shown in the picture above perform several key functions:

1. **Copy Obj User Defined:** Copies the User-Defined Properties of the **first
   selected object** to the system clipboard as plain text.

   ```{note}
   The other toolbar buttons apply to all selected objects.
   ```

```{note}
Fast access is limited to the first 20 selected objects to prevent performance
degradation with larger selections.
```
2. **Paste Obj User Defined:** Pastes the text from the system clipboard into
   the Properties of all selected objects.
3. **Clear Obj User Defined:** Clears the Properties of all selected objects.
4. **Vertex Color ON:** Enables the display of Vertex Color in the Viewport.
5. **Vertex Color OFF:** Disables the display of Vertex Color in the Viewport.

6. The **Display Properties on Viewport** checkbox allows you to display
Properties directly in the viewport, near the pivot point of each object.

7. The block of **Objects** below displays **copies** of the Properties of the
selected objects. Editing the text in this panel will not modify the actual
object properties. To make changes, use the **Clear** and **Paste** buttons.

8. The support section at the bottom of the panel provides quick access to the
documentation via the **Visit to Learning Web Site** button. Since you're
already here, you may have found it. For further assistance, contact the tool
developer by clicking the **Contact with Developer** button.
